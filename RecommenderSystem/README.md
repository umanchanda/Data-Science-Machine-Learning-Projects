# Recommender-System

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/llSourcell/recommender_system_challenge) challenge

Code to  fetch data came from [here](https://github.com/ciurana2016/recommender_system_py/blob/master/fetch_lastfm.py)

The goal was to use three different loss functions from the LightFM API to predict what songs people would listen to

The loss functions I used were
```
WARP
Logistic
BPR
```
