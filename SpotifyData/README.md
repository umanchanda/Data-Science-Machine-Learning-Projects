# spotify-artist-count

Got bored yesterday and decided to see what artists i listen to the most.

I throw all my songs into a single playlist called `Swank 'n Dank` which makes it easy to analyze my Spotify playlist data. 

The only issue is that it's currently two months old because after I requested the data from Spotify, I left it on my computer until I suddenly remembered that I had this trove of data lying around and decided to play around with it. 

One of my issues with the dataset is that if there are multiple artists collaborating on a song, the artist shows up as `Various Artists` instead of listing their names, separated by commas. So my results aren't entirely accurate but they're pretty close. 

I've currently requested my Spotify data so I can hopefully update my results (especially since I decided to add a bunch of Katy Perry songs so that might change things up a little).
